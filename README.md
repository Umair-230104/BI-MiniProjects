Task 7 

In the task we use the mean() method to calcuulate the averages and then created diagrams by using matplotlib.
In the diagrams there is shown the average number compared with both red and white wine.

a)
diagram B shows the average quality for both red and white wine. White wine has the higest average of quality of the wine and the diferrence is by 23.
digram C shows the average level of alcohol for both red and white wine. White wine has the higest average of aclocohol of the wine.
diagram D shows the average quantity of residual suger for both rend and white wine? White wine has the highest quantitu of residual sugar.

e)
Residual sugar does not appear to significantly influence perceived wine quality.
Especially for rødvin residual sugar doesn’t vary much, and for hvid vin. 
Even high-sugar wines don’t consistently have higher quality.

Alcohol content does appear to positively influence wine quality.
Especially when it’s in the 11–14% range.
But more in white win where high-quality ratings (8–9) are more frequent with higher alcohol percentages.
