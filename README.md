Task 4
Dependent variable: quality
Independent variables: 
fixed acidity, volatile acidity, citric acid, residual sugar, chlorides, free sulfur dioxide, 
total sulfur dioxide, density, pH, sulphates, alcohol	


Task 7 

In the task we use the mean() method to calcuulate the averages and then created diagrams by using matplotlib.
In the diagrams there is shown the average number compared with both red and white wine.

a)
diagram B shows the average quality for both red and white wine. White wine has the higest average of quality of the wine and the diferrence is by 23.
digram C shows the average level of alcohol for both red and white wine. White wine has the higest average of aclocohol of the wine.
diagram D shows the average quantity of residual suger for both rend and white wine? White wine has the highest quantitu of residual sugar.

e)
Residual sugar does not appear to significantly influence perceived wine quality.
Especially for rødvin residual sugar doesn’t vary much, and for hvid vin. 
Even high-sugar wines don’t consistently have higher quality.

Alcohol content does appear to positively influence wine quality.
Especially when it’s in the 11–14% range.
But more in white win where high-quality ratings (8–9) are more frequent with higher alcohol percentages.


Task 9

We have divided the wine's pH values into 5 and 10 equal intervals (bins), respectively, to get a better overview of how the acidity is distributed. The results show that the vast majority of wines have a pH value between approximately 3.1 and 3.5, which means that most wines have a moderate level of acidity. The 5-bin division provides a quick overview, while the 10-bin division shows a more detailed distribution.

The bar charts visualize these divisions. The chart with 5 bins clearly shows that most wines fall within the first two intervals, while the chart with 10 bins offers a finer breakdown and shows a more even distribution across a slightly broader range. Both charts help in understanding the pH distribution and how the wines are positioned relative to each other.

This insight can be useful for both wine producers and consumers who are interested in the role of acidity in the taste of wine.

Task 12

residual sugar, total sulfur dioxide, pH and sulphates are dropped as they have weak correlation under 0.05
there are no highly correlated attributes the highest alchohol with 0.48 which is not high enough to worry about.
